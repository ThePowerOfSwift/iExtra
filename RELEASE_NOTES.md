git tags.

Note that iExtra doesn't use semver. Breaking changes can occur on minor version
bumps, but not on revision bumps.


## 1.2.0

The action block-based gesture recognizer view extensions have been renamed. The
action block now completes with the gesture that triggered the action. This is a
breaking change.
