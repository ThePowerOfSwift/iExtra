## About iExtra

iExtra is a Swift library that contains most of the general functionality that
I use in my various apps. There is no real focus, just a bag of bytes.



## Demo Project

To run the demo project, clone the repo and run `pod install` from the Example
directory first. You can then open the generated iExtra.xcworkspace file.

For now, the demo is just the host application used to run the unit test suite.
It has no testable stuff.



## Requirements

iExtra requires iOS 8 or later.



## Installation

iExtra is not yet available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Instead,
install it by pointing the pod to this repository.


```ruby
pod "iExtra"
```
