 The ~> operator makes it easy to run blocks on a background
 thread then run a callback block on the main thread as soon
 as the background block completes.
 
 You can either call blocks with no return values which then
 trigger a parameterless callback block, or call blocks with
 a return value which then triggers the callback block using
 the return value as an input parameter, as such:

 ```swift
{ println("hello,") } ~> { println(" world") }
{ "hello," } ~> { println("\($0) world") }
 ```

 Note that the line before a {} ~> {} as well a the {} ~> {}
 line itself must use SEMICOLONS to prevent compile errors.
