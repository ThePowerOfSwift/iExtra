/*
    The ~> operator makes it easy to run a block on
    a background thread and run a callback block on
    the main thread as soon as the background block
    finishes.

    You can either run a block with no return value,
    then run a parameterless callbacl block, or run
    a block with a return value and pass the return
    value to the callback block, as such:

    { println("hello,") } ~> { println(" world") }
    { "hello," } ~> { println("\($0) world") }

    Note that the line before a {} ~> {} as well as
    the {} ~> {} line itself must use SEMICOLONS to
    prevent compile errors in XCode 6.
