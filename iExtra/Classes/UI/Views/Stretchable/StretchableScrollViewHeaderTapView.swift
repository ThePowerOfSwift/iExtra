 This view is added as a transparent overview, above any
 scroll views that uses a stretchable header. It will be
 resized to cover the visible part of the header, and is
 then responsible for throttling all taps that are meant
 for the header, but (since the table view will cover it)
 won't reach it if this view is not applied.
 
 For now, the class automatically finds all sub views to
 the header, that are enabled and visible and are either
 a button or have a gesture recognizer bound to it. If a
 view that should be tappable fails to be detected, have
 a look at these criterias.
