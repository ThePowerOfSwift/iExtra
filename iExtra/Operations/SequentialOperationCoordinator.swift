 This protocol specializes `OperationCoordinator` and has an
 auto-implemented `performOperations(:completion:) that will
 perform all operations sequentially.
 
 When you implement this protocol, you therefore do not have
 to implement any functionality at all except to either call
 `performOperations` with a set of operations or simply make
 your implementation provide its own operations and keep the
 `ParallelOperationCoordinator` implementation private.
