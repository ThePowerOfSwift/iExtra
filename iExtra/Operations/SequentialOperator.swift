 This protocol specializes the `CollectionOperator` protocol
 and can be implemented by classes that perform an operation
 in sequence on every item in a collection.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you just have to implement
 `performOperation(onItem:completion:)` since the collection
 function is already implemented as a protocol extension. Do
 rememeber to call the item completion for every item, since
 the completion call makes the execution proceed.
 
 When the operation completely finishes, the completion will
 receive an error array, where every error is item-specific.
