 This protocol should be implemented by classes that perform
 an operation on batches of items from a typed collection.
 
 When you implement this protocol, implement everything that
 is required by `CollectionOperator` then also implement the
 `performOperation(onBatch:completion:)` function. This will
 be called for every item batch. It's also very important to
 call the batch completion, since implementations rely on it.

    var batchSize: Int { get }
    
    func performOperation(onBatch batch: [T], completion: @escaping BatchCompletion)
