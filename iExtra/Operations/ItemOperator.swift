 This protocol should be implemented by classes that perform
 an operation on individual items in a typed collection.
 
 When you implement this protocol, implement everything that
 is required by `CollectionOperator` then also implement the
 `performOperation(onItem:completion:)` function, which will
 be called for every item in the collection. It is also very
 important to call the item completion since implememtations
 rely on it.

    typealias ItemCompletion = (Error?) -> ()
    
    func performOperation(onItem item: T, completion: @escaping ItemCompletion)
