 This protocol specializes the `BatchOperation` protocol. It
 will perform its operation sequentially on every item batch
 from the collection. This logic is already implemented as a
 protocol extension.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you therefore just have to
 implement `performOperation(onBatch:completion:)`.
