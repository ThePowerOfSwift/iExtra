/*
 
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that perform an
 operation on every object in a collection.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you just have to implement
 `performOperation(on:completion:)` and make sure to execute
 the completion once the operation completes. Then just call
 `startOperating(on:completion:)` on any collection of items
 to process them sequentially. You will receive a completion
 callback when the operation has been performed on evey item
 in the collection.
 
 The protocol is designed for asynchronicity, like a network
 request, but can be used for synchronous operations as well.
