 This protocol can be implemented by classes that perform an
 operation on individual items in a typed collection.
 
 When you implement this protocol, implement everything that
 is required by `CollectionOperation` and also implement the
 `performOperation(onItem:completion:)` function, which will
 be called for every item. It is also very important to call
 the item completion, since item operations may rely on this
 completion coordinate their execution.
