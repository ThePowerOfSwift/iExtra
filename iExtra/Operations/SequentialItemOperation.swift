 This protocol specializes the `ItemOperation` protocol, and
 will perform its operation sequentially on each item in the
 collection. This logic is already implemented as a protocol
 extension.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you therefore just have to
 implement `performOperation(onItem:completion:)`.
