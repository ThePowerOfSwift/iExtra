/*
 
 This protocol specializes the `CollectionOperator` protocol
 and can be implemented by classes that perform an operation
 in sequence on batches of items in a collection.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you just have to implement
 `performOperation(onBatch:completion)` since the collection
 function is already implemented as a protocol extension. It
 is very important to call the batch completion every time a
 batch operation completes, since every completion makes the
 execution proceed.
