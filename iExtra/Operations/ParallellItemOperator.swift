/*
 
 This protocol specializes the `CollectionOperator` protocol
 and can be implemented by classes that perform an operation
 in parallell on every item in a collection.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you just have to implement
 `performOperation(onItem:completion:)` since the collection
 function is already implemented as a protocol extension. It
 is very important to call the item completion for each item,
 since all completions are needed to complete the execution.

        collection.forEach {
            performOperation(onItem: $0) { error in
                errors.append(error)
