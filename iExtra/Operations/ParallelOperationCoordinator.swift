 This protocol specializes `OperationCoordinator` as well as
 `ParallelItemOperation` and therefore provides a complete
 implementation to perform multiple operations sequentially.
 
 When you implement this protocol, you therefore do not have
 to implement any functionality at all. If you implement the
 protocol publicly, you just have to call `performOperations`.
 If you implement it privately, you can have any class logic
 make use of the functionality it provides.
