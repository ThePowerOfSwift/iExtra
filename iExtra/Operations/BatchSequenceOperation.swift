 This protocol can be implemented by classes that perform an
 operation on batched groups of object from a collection.
 
 When implementing this protocol, you just have to implement
 `performOperation(on:completion:)` and make sure to execute
 the completion once the operation completes. Then just call
 `startOperating(on:batchSize:completion)` on any collection
 of items, to sequentially process them in batches. You will
 receive a callback when the operation has been performed on
 evey batch.
 
 The protocol is designed for asynchronicity, like a network
 request, but can be used for synchronous operations as well.
